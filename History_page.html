        <h1>Early History</h1>
        <p>support from the city council and after some financial support Westhills first house was built in 1968 however the name Westhill has existed for longer than this with its origins dating back to the mid 1800 when a man John Anderson had bought two estates Wester Kinmundy and Blackhills. These names are even older possibly dating back later than the 1600s however John Anderson decided to join the names creating the name Westhill. Lots of these early names and people are represented by street names in Westhill. With streets like Kinmundy Drive and buildings such as Ashdale Hall was one of the main financial backers early on.</p>
