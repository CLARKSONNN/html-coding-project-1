           however the name westhill has exitsted for longer then this with its orgians dating back to the mid 1800 when a man John Anderson had bought two estates Wester Kinmundy and Blackhills. these names being even older posible dating back 
           later then the 1600 however John Anderson deciced to join the names creating the name Westhill. lots of these early names and people are repsented by street names in Westhill. with streets like Kinmundy drive and or building such as 
           the ashdale hall who was one on the main financial backers early on.
