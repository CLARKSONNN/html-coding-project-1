Design 



Colours
When deciding on colours for my website, I decided I wanted to stick with three colours. One for the page banner, another for the navbar, footer, borders and backgrounds of elements and lastly, the background colour. The colour of the text is either white or black, depending on the background. I had a look at the webpage colour palette and used a blue to begin with then, I used the inbuilt colour picker in the code to change it to green, as I associated green with my hometown a lot more than blue. The brown came through looking at the colour plates and deciding the brown looked the best with the green, in my opinion. I then just used white for the background I believe it is slightly off-white but hard to notice.

Navbar design
I decided on a normal nav bar design as it was easy to implement, I did this by using a list of links and then having this list display inline. I removed the list and link styling leaving blank text. Then I used the block to have each one look more like a button. Finally, I added the background colour and had this change colour when hovering to again give that button a look. The Nav bar also stays at the top of the screen after scrolling down which looks nice and is easy to implement

Footer design
This is much the same as the nav bar just not inline and in the centre of the page I also added headers is there where multiple types of links. 

Overall body design
Add margins to give a small amount of space between the side of the page and the start of the text and the background colour has been changed.

Page banner
Large green background with white writing with the town name at the top and then the page title underneath felt this was simple yet modern looking and very easy to implement 

Image design
The image design has changed the most going from very similar to how the map looks on the homepage, to now just having a subtle brown border and when you put your mouse over a title comes in from the bottom and overlays the picture. The title is white with an underline. I used a template from WH3 schools, to begin with

Before adopting it removing the background changed the positions of the text to be at the bottom and to have an underline and refined the code as due to these changes some code was removed.  

Problems while implementing:
As mentioned before one problem I had with my code was the bootstrap changing the look of my webpage. This was fixed by just adding Bootstrap to all pages, so they all look the same.

Another problem was my nav bar having things go over it while scrolling down sometimes or completely disappear when reaching the bottom of the page. Fixed this by adding the line Z-index:1000; so, it would stay in front of everything on the webpage.
The final problem was the image header for the map breaking when Bootstrap was added. It was no longer overlapping the image slightly. This was fixed by changing the margin-top on the map styling. 

Page layout:
I chose for all my pages to appear on the left side of the page beside the models on the visit page just keeping all the images working well with any other elements. The main downside to this though is it leaves a lot of white space at times
Moda button:
Changed the background colour to the same green as the same as page banner and when hovering over it changes to the same colour as the nav bar
